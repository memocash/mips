## Abstract

Add action prefixes for sending money between users.
This includes not just sending, but requesting payment.

## Motivation

There are some cases where people like to publicly send money to each other.
This is evident by services like Venmo where many people will choose to publicly share their payments.

## Specification

Add two new protocol actions:

| Action | Prefix | Values |
|---|---|---|
| Send money | 0x6d24 | txhash(0/30), message(184/217) |
| Request money (invoice) | 0x6d25 | address(35), message(179) |

Transaction hash is an optional field in send money to indicate if paying a specific invoice.

## Reference Implementation

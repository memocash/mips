# Memo Improvement Proposals (MIPs)

Generally, memo features are opt-in.
Clients can choose whether to support or not support each action.
For instance, Wewo has [blogs](https://wewo.cash/blogs/) and
Memberapp has [maps](https://memberapp.github.io/#map).
Memo.cash doesn't yet support either feature.

Since consensus is not required, there isn't currently a need for a strict approval process.
However, sharing protocol additions and motivations is helpful for healthy collaboration.

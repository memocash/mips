## Abstract

Shared connections was the first iteration of web of trust,
showing which users are more likely to be trustworthy.
The next phase is to moderate users that you do not want to see.
To ease blocking users, you can also follow other user's block lists.

## Motivation

It is not uncommon to be harassed on the internet.
Some people also just do not want to see posts from other certain people.
Blocking other users has often been requested
and even has been implemented using a browser plugin.

Some platforms can also get lots of trolls.
Instead of everyone having to be vigilant,
it is easier if you can share your block lists with others.
